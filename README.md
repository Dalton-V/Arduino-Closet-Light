# Arduino-Closet-Light
An Arduino based automatic lighting system.
This system uses a sonar sensor to see when the door is opened by reading how far away it is.
It turns on the lights when the distance gets bigger because the door is opened, it then turns off when the distance is smaller because the door is closed.
